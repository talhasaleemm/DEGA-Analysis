# output/ — Expected outputs and descriptions

**This folder contains the analysis outputs (figures, tables, and summaries) generated by the notebooks.**  
Large output files are not committed to the repo by default. The examples below are taken from the `deg_analysis_output` archive produced by the Colab run.

Place your outputs in `output/` (or set notebooks to write to `output/`) so that results are easy to find and packaged.

## Files produced by the pipeline (what they are and where they are used)

### Tabular outputs
- `expression_filtered.csv`  
  Filtered expression matrix used as the basis for downstream analyses (genes × samples). Created in EDA notebooks after low-count filtering and sample QC.

- `comprehensive_deg_results.csv`  
  Per-gene statistical testing output (t-statistic, p-value, Mann–Whitney results, effect sizes). This is the primary differential expression results table.

- `publication_ready_results.csv`  
  Curated results table: includes gene symbols, log2 fold changes, adjusted p-values, annotations that are formatted for figures/tables in a manuscript.

- `supplementary_all_genes_analysis.csv`  
  Larger table with gene-level statistics and all supporting columns (useful for supplementary materials).

- `treatment_effect_summary.csv`  
  A concise CSV summarizing group-level treatment effects and effect size metrics.

- `sample_metadata.csv`  
  Sample metadata (sample id, group, other covariates) used across notebooks. This file is critical — many notebooks assume it exists.

### Figures & visual outputs
- `volcano_plot.png`  
  Volcano plot showing log2 fold change vs. -log10(padj). Useful for visual selection of candidate DE genes.

- `ma_plot.png`  
  MA plot (average expression vs log fold change) for assessing expression-dependent biases.

- `top_genes_heatmap.png`  
  Clustered heatmap of the most significant / top variable genes across samples.

- `top_genes_boxplots.png`  
  Boxplots or violin plots for top DE genes showing group distributions.

- `exploratory_analysis.png`  
  Multi-panel PCA / correlation / QC plot used to explore sample-level relationships.

- `quality_assessment.png`  
  Diagnostic plots: Q-Q, residuals, distribution checks, and other final quality control visualizations.

- `expression_clusters.png`  
  Visualization summarizing clusters (from KMeans / hierarchical clustering) of gene expression patterns.

- `treatment_effect_preview.png` and `comprehensive_treatment_validation.png`  
  Plots related to treatment effect estimates and validation checks (sensitivity runs).

### Misc
- `statistical_summary.txt`  
  Plain-text summary of numbers (total genes tested, number significant, numbers up/down, top gene lists). Useful for quick inspection and logging.

## Where to find these files in the repo
- Expected location: `output/figures/` for images and `output/tables/` for tabular outputs. Notebooks in `/notebooks/` will write to these paths by default; change output paths in the notebook top cells if you want to write to a different directory.

---

## Archiving & sharing
- The `Download Output` notebook includes a helper to create a zip archive (e.g. `deg_analysis_output.zip`). To recreate the archive locally:

  python -c "from src.io import create_results_archive; create_results_archive('output', 'deg_analysis_output.zip')"
